## Sentinel: Scalable Distributed Audit Log Service

**Sentinel** is a high-throughput, append-only event sourcing system designed to provide compliance, traceability, and "time-travel" debugging capabilities for enterprise microservices.

It ingests structured business events via a REST API, buffers them through a Kafka stream to handle backpressure, and persists them into a partitioned PostgreSQL database for efficient historical querying.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Asynchronous Ingestion:** Fire-and-forget API design (`202 Accepted`) ensures the logging system never blocks the main application.
* **Backpressure Handling:** Uses **Kafka** to decouple producers from consumers, allowing the system to absorb massive traffic spikes without data loss.
* **Database Partitioning:** PostgreSQL tables are partitioned by month. This allows for efficient querying of recent data and O(1) archival/deletion of old data (dropping partitions vs. expensive `DELETE` rows).
* **JSONB Indexing:** specific changes (`before`/`after` states) are stored in `JSONB` columns with GIN indexing, allowing for deep queries like "Who changed the *status* field to *failed*?".
* **Hexagonal Architecture:** The codebase strictly separates business logic (Domain) from infrastructure (Adapters), making it highly testable and maintainable.

### Tech Stack

* **Language:** Go (Golang) 1.23
* **Streaming:** Apache Kafka & Zookeeper
* **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 (with Range Partitioning)
* **Infrastructure:** Docker & Docker Compose
* **Libraries:** `segmentio/kafka-go`, `lib/pq` (Pure Go drivers)

### Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Make (optional, but recommended)

#### Clone & Spin Up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minhajul/sentinel.git
cd sentinel

# Start Kafka, Zookeeper, Postgres, API, and Consumer
make run-infra
# OR
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Initialize Database

The database needs the initial schema and partitions created.

```bash
# Connect to the running Postgres container
docker exec -it sentinel_postgres psql -U user -d sentinel_db

# Paste the contents of /migrations/000001_init_schema.up.sql
# (Or use a migration tool if configured)
```

#### Test the Pipeline

**Send an Event (Producer):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "actor_id": "user_123",
    "action": "billing_update",
    "resource_type": "invoice",
    "resource_id": "inv_999",
    "changes": {"status": "paid", "amount": 500},
    "metadata": {"ip": "192.168.1.50"}
  }'
```

**Verify Storage (Consumer -> DB):**
Check the logs to see the Consumer picking it up:

```bash
docker logs -f sentinel_consumer
```

Query the Database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE actor_id = 'user_123';
```

### Project Structure

This project follows the **Standard Go Project Layout** and **Ports & Adapters (Hexagonal)** pattern.

### Engineering Decisions (Why I did this?)

#### Why Kafka instead of direct DB writes?

Direct writes couple the availability of the logging service to the database. If the DB slows down under load, the main application hangs. By using Kafka, we introduce a buffer. The API accepts the request instantly (`202 Accepted`) and offloads the heavy write operation to a background worker. This provides **resilience** and **load smoothing**.

#### Why Table Partitioning?

Audit logs grow indefinitely. Indexing a table with 100M+ rows degrades write and read performance. By partitioning by **Month**:

* **Writes** go to a smaller, hot table (e.g., `audit_logs_2024_01`).
* **Reads** for recent data are faster.
* **Archival** becomes a metadata operation (Detach Partition) rather than a row-by-row `DELETE` which causes table locking and vacuum issues.

#### Why JSONB for `changes`?

Audit logs vary wildly in structure. An `invoice` change has different fields than a `user_profile` change. A rigid SQL schema would require hundreds of nullable columns or EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) which is slow. PostgreSQL `JSONB` with **GIN Indexing** gives us the flexibility of NoSQL (MongoDB-like) with the ACID compliance of a relational DB.

### Future Roadmap

* [ ] **S3 Archival Worker:** Automatic job to move partitions older than 3 months to AWS S3 (Parquet format) and drop them from Postgres.
* [ ] **gRPC Support:** Adding a gRPC port to the API for lower latency internal communication.
* [ ] **Auth Middleware:** JWT validation for the API.
